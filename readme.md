A joke website based on the domain howdoi.land
==============================================

Backstory
---------

There was a time when I was really into frivolous domains (including, at one
point, the domain "frivolous.domains"). Soon after .land domains were
introduced, I registered **howdoi.land** and populated it with an animated
martlet. (A martlet is a mythical heraldic bird that has no feet and thus can
never land. Martlets also happen to be the official symbol of McGill
University.)

The domain itself has since expired, but you can still view this priceless work
of art thanks to the wonders of GitHub Pages:

Martlet graphic: I took [the canonical martlet SVG on Wikipedia][svg] and
altered it to make it look like it was flying. The animation itself was done
using techniques similar to those described on Bryan Braun's blog: [How I
rebuilt "Flying Toasters" using only CSS animations][blog]
